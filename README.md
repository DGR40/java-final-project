# java-final-project
This is my final project for my Java Course. We were tasked with writing two algorithms to help Indiana Jones navigate a given map with a given amount of moves in order to find the treasure, escape the cave, and collect as much gold on the way in the shortest amount of time possible. I coded this project by myself.
